What MAP++ Solves
-----------------

Mooring models can be classified into two groups: static models and dynamic models. 
Static models ignore the inertia forces and fluid drag loads, and only account for the mean forces in the mooring system, including elasticity, weight (in fluid), and geometric nonlinearities. 
Static models are the type concerned in MAP++. 
Extra steps are taken to reformulate the classic single line, closed--form solution :cite:`irvine1992` into a piece-wise, multi-sgemented system.
This piece wise system is composed of a collection of nodes and elements.

Each element in :ref:`fig_1` is expressed as a single line counterpart in two configurations. 
One configuration has the line hanging freely, whereas the second orientation account for friction and contact at the bottom boundary.
